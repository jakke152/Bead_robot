/*
Simple Routine for Nucleo Board for ROCO104 Buggy Motor Control and Microswitches
Heavy edit from previous ROCO103PP code
Now for PRO101 February 2023 - M R Simpson
Motor Class can now be instansiated with all four pins needed to control the H Bridge
with a member functions as follows

Motor::Speed(float A, Float B) range -0.1 to +1.0 to give full reverse to full forward for A/B motors
Motor::Stop()       STOP
Motor::Fwd(float)   Forward but floating point number (range 0.0 to 1.0)
Motor::Rev(float)   Reverse but floating point number (range 0.0 to 1.0)
